This GitHub repository serves as a central hub for collecting protocols, pipelines, and code developed within the AgronOmics project. By bringing together these essential resources, we aim to create a one-stop shop for project data and methodologies, ensuring researchers have seamless access to the tools they need. Having all data, protocols, and analysis pipelines in a single, well-organized location not only enhances collaboration but also accelerates discoveries, improves reproducibility, and fosters innovation. By streamlining data analysis and eliminating fragmentation, this repository empowers scientists to focus on advancing omics research and driving meaningful scientific breakthroughs.
