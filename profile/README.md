The GitAgritech repository serves as a central hub for collecting protocols, pipelines, and code developed within Spoke 1 of the National Research Centre for Agricultural Technologies (AGRITECH)” funded under the Next Generation EU program PNRR MUR – M4C2 (Missione 4 Componente 2) Investimento 1.4, aimed at dissecting morphophysiological and molecular mechanisms of adaptation to stress conditions. By bringing together these essential resources, we will create a one-stop shop for project data and methodologies, developed in the field of omics research, and focused on understanding the bases of resilience and adaptation to climate change in plant, animal and microbial genetic resources relevant to agriculture. GitAgritech ensures permanent access to project resources and is meant to foster future collaborations and innovation for sustainability and resilience of agricultural ecosystems. A GitHub repository typically contains various files that define the project, including the scripts and pipelines it uses.
